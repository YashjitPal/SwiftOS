<summary><h3>üé∂ Definitive Song Ranking</h3></summary>

<p>The core feature of SwiftOS. Forget simple polls; this is a true ranking engine.</p>

<h4>1. Visual Album Selection</h4>
<p>Your journey begins by choosing an album from a beautiful, responsive grid of album cards. Each card features the album's emoji and track count, making the choice an experience in itself. As soon as you click an album, the ranking begins‚Äîno extra buttons needed.</p>

<h4>2. Smart Sorting Battle</h4>
<p>The app uses a powerful <strong>Merge Sort algorithm</strong> for its ranking. This isn't random‚Äîit's a "divide and conquer" method that has you compare songs head-to-head to build a perfectly sorted list. It guarantees a definitive ranking with the minimum number of comparisons, tracked by a sleek progress bar.</p>

<h4>3. Podium Finish & Sharing</h4>
<p>The grand finale! Your results are displayed on a stunning podium that highlights your top 3 songs with gold, silver, and bronze styling. You can then view the full, definitive list and download a high-quality image of your ranking to share with the world.</p>

# üöÄ Tech Showcase
<details>
<summary><h3>üíª Core Technologies</h3></summary>


This project is a testament to the power of vanilla web technologies when used with modern techniques and a strong design vision.

Smart Sorting with Async/Await: The Merge Sort algorithm is implemented using async/await to pause the sorting logic while waiting for user input. This allows a complex, recursive algorithm to work seamlessly with an interactive UI.

Dynamic Theming with CSS Variables: The entire color scheme is controlled by a handful of root CSS variables. JavaScript simply updates these variables, and the cascade does the rest, allowing for instant, sitewide theme changes.

Glassmorphism & Responsive Design: The UI is built using the "glassmorphism" trend, leveraging backdrop-filter for the blurred glass effect. Modern CSS like Flexbox and Grid ensures the layout is fully responsive and beautiful on any device.
